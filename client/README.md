PicSmart is a social media app on which users can post their pictures to share them with the whole world.
This app is created by using react and node js just for fun and to practice my skills.

Although it is is not fully-functional but these are some of the features of this app-

Unsplash API is used to get some pictures and some description about them which is rendered in the browser.

There is a 'Add New Post' button in the header which allows to upload a post from the local computer to backend server.
the server saves the post and in response sends that post back and then renders it on the home page.

There is also a follow section in this application in which user can follow others and if user dont like ,he or she can also remove that person from his or her's follow section.

The user can also like the posts and see the share options.

User authentication feature is not available yet,the sign-in and sign-up buttons are just dummy buttons.
